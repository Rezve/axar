# Building real applications, not just demos

Most agent frameworks today miss the mark: they’re designed to impress on stage, not deliver in production. Flashy demos and overengineered complexity have overshadowed what truly matters—giving developers the tools they need to build reliable, robust applications.

## What developers really need

In the race toward AGI, we’ve overlooked a critical truth: production-grade application development demands clarity, control, and reliability. Developers need solutions that are intuitive to code, straightforward to debug, and simple to improve. We need a framework that speaks to real developers—delivering practical solutions without compromise.

## Why code is king

Agents are only as good as their instructions. And when reliability is the goal, the best way to write those instructions is through code. Code gives developers clarity, control, and precision—qualities that matter more than ever in the unpredictable world of LLMs. Explicit, structured communication with LLMs isn’t just nice to have; it’s essential for better outcomes.

## Meet AXAR AI

**AXAR AI** is designed for developers building production-grade applications. It gives you full control to create predictable, robust solutions that integrate LLMs into proven development workflows. AXAR feels familiar and intuitive—letting you code as you would with any other application. No unnecessary complexity, no steep learning curve.

## Our philosophy: practicality over hype

At AXAR, we focus on what developers need: tools that are reliable, practical, and rooted in solid coding principles. We’re not chasing AGI or following trends—we’re here to help you build applications you can trust in production. AXAR combines the best of traditional coding practices with the power of LLMs, making it easy to integrate AI into real-world workflows.

If you’re building something real, something that _works_ in the real world—AXAR AI is your framework.

## Why use AXAR AI

### Type-first design

Structured, typed inputs and outputs with TypeScript ensure predictable and reliable agent workflows.

### Familiar and intuitive

Built on patterns like dependency injection and decorators, so you can use what you already know.

### Explicit control

Define agent behavior, guardrails, and validations directly in code for clarity and maintainability.

### Transparent

Includes tools for real-time logging and monitoring, giving you full control and insight into agent operations.

### Lightweight

Minimalistic design with little to no overhead for your codebase.

### Model and platform agnostic

Works with OpenAI, Anthropic, Mistral, and more, with easy extensibility for additional models.

### Streamed outputs

Streams LLM responses with built-in validation for fast and accurate results.

### Production-ready

Built for maintainable and reliable applications in production environments.

## Inspirations

AXAR is built on ideas from some of the best tools and frameworks out there. We use Vercel's AI SDK and take inspiration from Pydantic AI, OpenAI’s Swarm, and LangGraph by LangChain. These projects have set the standard for reliable, developer-friendly AI tooling, and AXAR builds on that foundation.
