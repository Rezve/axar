# Contributing to AXAR

Hey there! 👋 Thanks for checking out AXAR. Whether you’re fixing a bug, adding a feature, or improving docs, we’re super excited to have you here. Let’s make this as smooth as possible.

---

## How to contribute

### 1. Fork it, clone it, and get started

1. **Fork the repo** (you know the drill).
2. Clone your fork:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/axar.git
   cd axar
   ```
3. Install dependencies (we use npm):
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
4. Create a new branch for your magic:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b cool-feature
   ```

---

### 2. Write your code

- Keep it clean and readable. Future-you (and others) will thank you.
- Stick to TypeScript best practices. Type safety is life. 💻
- Minimize dependencies. No one likes unnecessary bloat.
- Add comments if the code isn’t obvious. Help your fellow devs out.

---

### 3. Test your changes

Nobody likes a broken build. Run the tests:

```bash
npx jest
```

If you’re adding something new, add tests for it. Don’t leave your code out in the wild without some protection. 🔍

---

### 4. Push and create a pull request

Once you’re happy:

1. Commit your changes with a meaningful message:
   ```bash
   git commit -m "Fix: Handle null inputs in getCustomerContext"
   ```
2. Push your branch:
   ```bash
   git push origin cool-feature
   ```
3. Open a PR (pull request) on the main AXAR repo. Tell us:
   - What problem you’re solving.
   - How you fixed it.
   - Anything else we should know.
